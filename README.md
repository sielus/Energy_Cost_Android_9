# How it works? 
**It's very simple!** 

In house manager  you can create any rooms as many as you want ( or you can select from default rooms schema )

After this just enter your new room and add some devices ( Ofcourse you can add your own devices or choose from default devices )

Application will calc some things for you like **how many your device will use kWh and how many will it cost you at 24 h / 30 day / 1 year**

This data will be shown in some nice ( _in my opinion :d_ ) charts.
